    <h1>Hey (Love Interest Name [none atm]), if you're reading this just know that You Are Beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è</h1>
    <h2>
        I could write a thousand pages and still not fully capture your beauty. 
        You are the most breathtaking person I have ever known, inside and out. 
        Every time I see you, my heart skips a beat, and I am reminded of how lucky I am. 
        Your kindness, your smile, your warmth‚Äîthey make my world brighter. 
        I love you more than words can ever express. Always and forever. üíñ
    </h2>
    
    <h4>Here's a poem that I wrote, it's called "Indescribable You":</h4>

    <p>"How do I tell of a beauty so rare,
        A glow like dawn in the crisp morning air?
        Words stumble, they falter, they fall away,
        For no verse can capture you, no words can stay.</p>
        
        <p>Your eyes, twin galaxies, deep and divine,
        Holding the stars, making them shine.
        Your smile‚Äîa sunrise, warm and bright,
        Turning my darkness into golden light.</p>
        
        <p>Your laughter, a melody, soft and true,
        A song that my heart beats only for you.
        Each whisper, each touch, a dream so sweet,
        A love so perfect, so pure, so complete.</p>
        
        <p>Yet words are weak, they fail and fade,
        For you, my love, cannot be conveyed.
        Indescribable, infinite, timeless, free,
        You are the only poem my soul will ever need."</p>
    </p>
